In order for `Request.java` to work as intended, create a file in this folder called `secret.yml` and paste following
line to it:

```yml
session: "<your-sessionkey-here>"
```

Replace `<your-sessionkey-here>` with you actual session-key (duh) that can be found on the official
site [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/).

Steps to follow to find your session-key:
`developer console > web storage > Cookies > session`
