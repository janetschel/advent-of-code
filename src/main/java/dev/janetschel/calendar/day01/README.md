# Solve times

<ins>Disclaimer</ins>: this year I will NOT recap the day, only post my solve times for it.  
If I am on the leaderboard (< 1000) it will be indicated with a single gold star. If I am on the public leaderboard (< 100) -- which will never actually happen -- It will be indicated with two gold stars.

That said, here are my solve times for day 1:

- `00:02:09` for part 1 (#724) ⭐️
- `00:05:10` for part 2 (#675) ⭐️

Delta (Δ) time from part 1 to part 2: `+00:03:01`  
Δ "places" from part 1 to part 2: `-49`

Thank you for coming to my TED talk
