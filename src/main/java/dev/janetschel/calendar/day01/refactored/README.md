I usually don't refactor Puzzles after I got the right solution to a problem.  
On some days -- however -- there is a benefit in refactoring the puzzle (mostly when I can expand my util package with interesting util-classes).

If I decide to refactor a puzzle it will be done in an extra class `RefactoredPuzzle.java` in the directory `dayx/refactored/` to not abstract away my "real" solution.

It will not always have a README.md.
