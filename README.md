# Advent of Code 
Welcome to my repo for all Advent of Codes [advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com/).  
I have decided to -- from now on -- redo all AoC's done so far (and all future AoC's) in Java, so I made this repository to host them all.

## Project/day setup
- macOS Monterey 12.0.1
- Maven 4.0.0 project with Java 17 LTS
- [./Makefile](https://github.com/janetschel/advent-of-code/blob/main/Makefile) to automatically create each new day from template files for THE CURRENT YEAR
- util package for whatever
- Day's ([dev/janetschel/calendar/dayx/](https://github.com/janetschel/advent-of-code/tree/main/src/main/java/dev/janetschel/calendar)) are set up like this:
  - `input.txt` for the input → needs to be copy + pasted manually (no fetch utils this year around -- I couldn't be bothered)
  - `Puzzle.java` for the actual solution each day
  - `README.md` for solve times (if year >= 2020, before that, I didn't do AoC)

<br/>
All you need to do if you want to create a new day to start coding is: 

- In the terminal navigate to `./`
- Type following: `make new`

This will generate the needed file structure for `day x` in this year's AoC

## Utils
My [utils](https://github.com/janetschel/advent-of-code/tree/main/src/main/java/dev/janetschel/utils) will have some handy functions/classes to work with the input.  

## Dynamic execution of code

Since this repo contains code to all AoC's and I needed the way to execute them all together AND independently of each other, there is a handy class (`Calendar.java`) which -- via reflection -- searches and executes all classes belonging to the specified year/day.

It works as follows: ([Calendar.java](https://github.com/janetschel/advent-of-code/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/janetschel/Calendar.java))
```java
@ExecutedDays(day = ALL_DAYS)
public class Calendar {
    private static final String CURRENT_YEAR = "2021";

    // ...
}
```

Change the annotation `@ExecutedDays` according to this regex:
```re
^ALL_DAYS|DAY_(?:0[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-5])$
```

And it will run the specified day (or all days) from the corresponding year.  
It searches all relevant packages and executes top level classes in these packages.  

If you want to exclude specific classes (like DTOs, ...) from executing place them in a folder either called:
- `modles` or 
- `refactored`.

A possible folder structure could look like this:
```
advent-of-code/
├── src.main.java.dev.janetschel
│   ├── calendar
│   │   └── year2021/
│   │       └── day01/                // <-- all this structure is generated by 'make new'
│   │           ├── refactored/       // <-- classes in this folder (or models) are not executed
│   │           ├── Puzzle.java
│   │           ├── README.md
│   │           └── input.txt  
│   └── utils/
├── Makefile 
└── template/                        // <-- change the files in this folder if you wish to modify your blueprint
```

When running/executing days, the output will be in following format:
```
Solutions for Advent of Code 2021
Day 01:
01.1: 1527 (-> took ~6.7ms [6699.458µs])
01.2: 1575 (-> took ~1.2ms [1208.291µs])
```

## (Public) Leaderboard appearances
Although each day will have its own `README.md` all of my leaderboard appearances (< 1000) for `<part1, part2>` will be listed here.  
For the exact solve times check out each day's `README.md`. 

- Day 1: #724, #675
- Day 2: ----, #650
